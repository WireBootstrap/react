# WireBootstrap for React
React is a component based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**WireBootstrap for React** features a React component that turns any WireBootstrap component into a React component that can be used inside React applications.  With this component, there is no need for WireBootstrap component authors to create a separate React version of their component.  

The solution also contains a sample project that illustrates how to use WireBootstrap in React applications.  This includes setting up access to data services using WireBootstrap data structures as well as the different ways in which the WireBootstrap React Component can be used with these data services.
