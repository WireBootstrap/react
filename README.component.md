# WireBootstrap for React
React is a component based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**WireBootstrap for React** features a React component that turns any WireBootstrap component into a React component that can be used inside React applications.  With this component, there is no need for WireBootstrap component authors to create a separate React version of their component.
